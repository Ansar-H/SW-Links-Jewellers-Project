        <p class="cs-text">
          To reduce the risk of issues, customers are expected to follow proper
          care practices:
        </p>
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li>
            Remove before exposure to water, chemicals, cleaning agents,
            perfumes, and lotions.
          </li>
          <li>Do not wear while swimming, exercising, or sleeping.</li>
          <li>
            Store properly in a soft pouch or lined box to avoid scratches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check clasps and settings regularly; if stones or fittings become
            loose through wear, this is the customer's responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Routine maintenance: we recommend professional cleaning and
            inspection to prolong the life of your jewellery.

          <li>
            <strong>Statutory Rights:</strong> These terms do not override your

            boundaries of what we will and will not cover.
          </li>
