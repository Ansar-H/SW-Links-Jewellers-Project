            <h2 class="cs-title">Our Bristol Story</h2>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Southwest Link Jewellers began with two friends united by a shared passion for beautiful jewellery. What started as collecting and trading pieces quickly evolved into something much bigger. We began investing in gold, creating our first bracelets, and driving around Bristol making personal deliveries to our growing customer base.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Those early days taught us the importance of building genuine relationships with our customers. We learned that people don't just buy jewellery - they invest in memories, celebrate milestones, and express their personal style. This understanding became the foundation of everything we do.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Today, we operate from our professional Bristol showroom, but we've never forgotten our roots. We still believe in personal service, honest pricing, and treating every customer like family. Our journey from passionate collectors to trusted jewellers reflects our commitment to growing alongside the Bristol community we're proud to serve.
